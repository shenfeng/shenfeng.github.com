Here are my few programming's way of saying "Hello world!":
**C Version:**
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        printf("%s","hello world!");
    }
**C++ Version:**
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        std::cout<<"hello world!";
    }
**JAVA Version:**
    public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
      }
    }

    (println "hello world!")
