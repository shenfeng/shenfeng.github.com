My name is 沈锋(shen feng), a software programmer, now working at
[Onycloud](http://onycloud.com). Before that I have served 2 companies:

1.[Autodesk China Research and Development Center](http://usa.autodesk.com/),
as an intern
2.  [TRS](http://www.trs.com.cn/), as an intern

I now live in Beijing, China.

I was born in Dazhu, Sichuan, China.

I do some coding for fun in my free time, most of them can be found on
[github](https://github.com/shenfeng). These days, spare time is
devoted to [Rssminer](http://rssminer.net), and intelligent RSS reader.

My personal email is shenedu at gmail dot com.

Here are my few programming way of saying "Hello world!":

{% highlight java %}
 // Java, the most familiar one
 public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("Hello world!");
   }
 }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight clojure %}
 ;; Clojure, the favorite one
 (println "hello world!")
{% endhighlight %}

[shenfeng.me](http://shenfeng.me) is my personal blog. I use it to do note for life and programming.
