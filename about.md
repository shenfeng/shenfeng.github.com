My name is 沈锋(shen feng), a software programmer, now working at

Here are my few programming way of saying "Hello world!":

{% highlight java %}
 // Java, the most familiar one
 public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("Hello world!");
   }
 }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight clojure %}
 ;; Clojure, the favorite one
 (println "hello world!")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
 // javascript, I like it.
 console.log("hello world!");
{% endhighlight %}
