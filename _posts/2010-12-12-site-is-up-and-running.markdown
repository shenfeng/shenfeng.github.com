Hello! my personal site is up and running!
**[Quercus: PHP in Java](http://quercus.caucho.com/ "quercus")**
Quercus is Caucho Technology's 100% Java implementation of PHP5
released under the Open Source GPL license

**[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org)**
WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website
or blog. We like to say that WordPress is both free and priceless
at the same time.

[sheneng.me](http://shenfeng.me) runs on wordpress, which runs on
tomcat by Quercus. I will use it to make note.
