title: 600k concurrent HTTP connections, with Clojure & http-kit

*original [http://http-kit.org/600k-concurrent-connection-http-kit.html](http://http-kit.org/600k-concurrent-connection-http-kit.html)*

*Edit(2013/1/29):*
http-kit is a event driven HTTP server & client for Clojure. It's open source, [https://github.com/http-kit](https://github.com/http-kit)

Inspired by [Scaling node.js to 100k concurrent connections!](http://blog.caustik.com/2012/04/08/scaling-node-js-to-100k-concurrent-connections/) and [Node.js w/250k concurrent connections!](http://blog.caustik.com/2012/04/10/node-js-w250k-concurrent-connections/). I did some test for http-kit!

[http-kit](http://http-kit.org) manages to make **600k** concurrent connections, on PC!

### Server's logic

The server read the length param from the request, generate a string of that length.

{% highlight clojure %}
;; main.clj
;; ~20k string
(def const-str (apply str (repeat 200 "http-kit is a http server & client
   written from scrach for high performance clojure web applications,
   support async and websocket")))

(defn handler [req]
  (let [length (to-int (or (-> req :params :length) 1024))]
    {:status 200
     :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
     :body (subs const-str 0 (max (min 10240 length) 1))}))

(defn -main [& args]
  (run-server (-> handler wrap-keyword-params wrap-params)
              {:port 8000})
  (println (str "Server started. listen at 0.0.0.0@8000")))

{% endhighlight %}

Start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
java -server -Xms3072m -Xmx3072m -cp `lein classpath` clojure.main -m main
{% endhighlight %}


### Linux config

The server need to set max allowed open file to a much larger value. The default value is ~1024

{% highlight sh %}
echo 9999999 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/nr_open
echo 9999999 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/file-max

# edit /etc/security/limits.conf, add the following line, need logout and login again
* - nofile 4999999

# set before run the server and test code
ulimit -n 4999999
{% endhighlight %}

More ports for test code to use

{% highlight sh %}
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1025 65535"
{% endhighlight %}

### Hardware & Software

The server and test code are both run on my desktop:

* **CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 4 core, 8 threads
* **RAM**: 16G @ 1333MHZ
* **OS** : Linux 3.2.0-2-amd64 #1 SMP Sun Apr 15 16:47:38 UTC 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux
* **http-kit**: "2.0-rc1"
* **JVM**: 1.7.0_04

### How to make 600k concurrent connections on a single PC

A IP can only issue most 65536 connections to a server, since socket port is unsigned short. But we can bypass this limit.
On Linux, it's quite easy to set up virtual network interface:

{% highlight sh %}

for i in `seq 200 230`; do sudo ifconfig eth0:$i 192.168.1.$i up ; done

{% endhighlight %}

Then your computer have many IPs, from `192.168.1.200` to `192.168.1.230`. The server bind to `0.0.0.0@port`, the client can connect
`192.168.1.200@port`, or `192.168.1.201@port`, etc. Per IP can have about 60K concurrent connections. Then the client can issue as many concurrent connections as it needed.

### Concurrency test code

The client opens 600k concurrent keep-alived connections to the server, request the server to return string of length randomly between 1 ~ 4096 bytes, read the response, idle 5s ~ 45s (randomly pick a value between), request again.

### How about ab test when 600k connections are kept

Issue this command from command line:

{% highlight sh %}
ab -n 100000 -c 10 -k http://127.0.0.1:8000/
{% endhighlight %}
