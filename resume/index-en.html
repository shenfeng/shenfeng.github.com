            <p>AVOS Systems is an Internet company founded by YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. We
              joined them in Sep, 2011 working in the Beijing Office. In there, I participated in a few
              projects:</p>
            <ul class="projects">

                <div class="detail"> We recreate delicious.com for Chinese users from ground up. As a main
                  developers(totally 3 devlopers), I wrote the major part of the backend using Clojure, the
                  whole android client, and part of the frontend. I also wrote some bash scripts to automate
                  the building, testing, packing and deployment.

                <div class="detail"> An internet service to help user collect and manage bookmarks, and create
                  stacks using collected bookmarks. As one of the main developer(totally 4), I implemented
                  part of the backend (in Python) and part of the frontend.

        <p class="info">In my spare time, I do coding for fun: learn by doing, to prove some ideas, to try something new. The Projects can be found on github:
          <a href="https://github.com/shenfeng">github.com/shenfeng</a> and <a href="https://github.com/http-kit/">github.com/http-kit</a>。Some of the popular ones：</p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>http-kit <a href="http://http-kit.org">http://http-kit.org</a></h3>

            <div class="detail"> http-kit is a minimalist, event-driven, high-performance Clojure HTTP server/client
              library with WebSocket and asynchronous support. Features <a
                                                                           href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/clojure-web-server-benchmarks">High performance</a>， <a

              Nginx）， <b><a href="http://http-kit.org/server.html">Simple and fridenly API</a></b>。The
              implementation is quite simple (about 3200 lines of code). It got some attentions in Clojure
              communitiy, and was voted in the front page of Hacks News for 2 times. It also received about 400
              stars in GitHub.<a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit">on github</a>

              <p>IO and threading model：Single thread（event loop）read socket，decode it as request，A thread pooling
                to compute request=>response, encode response，try to write the response to client， If buffer is
                full, then queue the unwritten respons to the event loop thread, wait for the buffer get
                flushed. </p>

              <p>Comparing to single thread based Node.js, http-kit is multi-threaded, so doing blocking database
                query is just fine.</p>

              <p>Before http-kit，I implemented HTTP client/server a few times：</p>

            <div class="detail"> A RSS reader, Like Google Reader，but with less features. I learned a lot from this
              project. I also implemented a realtime full text search and recommendation features. A few related
              projects get started for it:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit">http-kit</a>：An async HTTP server & client is

                  concept: May be I could do one from scratch, so, I wrote it.
                </li>
                <li> Template engine：<a href="https://github.com/shenfeng/mustache.clj">mustache.clj</a>：The API
                  is both simple and nice, and it's quite fast! Rssminer rely it to do the i18n.
                </li>
                <li> Database connection pool：<a href="https://github.com/http-kit/dbcp.clj">dbcp.clj</a>，By
                  using Threadlocal，it's very fast.

            <div class="detail"> I wrote it on the new year holiday of 2012. A Web Server for Web developers:
              automatically reload browsers when file changed, let developer focus on coding. No copy and paste
              javascript code are needed anymore, the Web developers just need to start http-watcher, and that's
              all.
